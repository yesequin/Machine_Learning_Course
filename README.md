## Glossary

ML = Machine Learning

Delimited text file: A plain text file where a specific character separates the data values.

Hadoop: An open-source framework designed to store and process large datasets across clusters of computers.

Model: A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis.

Nearest neighbor: A machine learning algorithm that predicts a target variable based on its similarity to other values in the dataset.

Neural networks: A computational model used in deep learning that mimics the structure and functioning of the human brain’s neural pathways. It takes an input, processes it using previous learning, and produces an output.

Recommendation engine: A computer program that analyzes user input, such as behaviors or preferences, and makes personalized recommendations based on that analysis.

Regression: A statistical model that shows a relationship between one or more predictor variables with a response variable.

Tabular data: Data that is organized into rows and columns.

Data science is the field of exploring, manipulating, and analyzing data, and using data to answer questions or make recommendations.

Data science can help organizations:

- Understand their enviroments
- Analyze existing issues
- Reveal previously hidden opportunities

Many organizations will use data science to focus on an specific problem, and so it’s essential to clarify the question that the organization wants answered. This is the First step for the data science project.

The next question is: What data do we need to solve the problem?, and Where will that data come from?

A data scientist should be:

- Curious
- Judgemental
- Argumentative

The data scientist role in an organization:

### File formats

A data format is how data is encoded so it can be stored within a data file type.

- Comma-separated values (CSV) / Tab-separated values (TSV). Commonly used format for storing tabular data as plain text where either the comma or the tab separates each value.
- Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet, or XLSX
- Extensible Markup Language, or XML. A language designed to structure, store, and enable data exchange between various technologies. It’s a markup language with set rules for encoding data
- Portable Document Format, or PDF
- JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON. Text-based open standard designed for transmitting structured data over the web. Considered as one of the best tools for sharing data.
